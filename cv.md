## About

I am the one who decided to change the successful career of a navigator to the profession of a developer. Even though I literally restarted my career from scratch, I am sure that my past experience in another engineering fields sets me apart from other newcomers.

I have experience in:

- organization of my work in a timely manner
- team management
- working in an extremely stressful environment
- quick grasping of new technologies
- making responsible decisions in situations where not only the company's finances, but even people's lives depend on it
- fast recognition of situations when I definitely need the help of senior colleagues
- knowledge of what it means to work not only in a team, but in a crew
- working in a multicultural environment

Cutting edge technology inspires me. I want their application in real life not only to help business, but also to improve the quality of life of people around. I want to be part of that future.
